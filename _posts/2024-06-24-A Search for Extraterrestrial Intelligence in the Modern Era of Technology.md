<span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;"> Dyson spheres are believed to be megastructures built around a host star that uses energy from the star. Many people think this kind of advanced civilisation exists, and the search for these spheres began around the early 60’s. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;"> Generally, when we observe an astronomical object like a star/galaxy, we get the light(Electro Magnetic Wave) from that object, which travels through space from the source object (star) to the primary lens of your telescope. We continuously monitor the amount of light received (flux) (The time series data of the received flux plotted over time is referred to as a light curve.) at different wavelengths, and we infer the physics from the data.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;">If a planet is orbiting a star, we should see the periodic dips in the star’s received flux. The interstellar medium plays an important role, but we were accurately able to detect the planets orbiting the stars (Transit Method). In the same way, we expect some abnormalities (like dips in the light curve) in the data if the Dyson sphere exists.</span>
