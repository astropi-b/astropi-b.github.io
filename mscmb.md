<span style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;">The **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)** is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the Big Bang theory and now serves as a valuable tool to study cosmic inflation. We anticipate that the CMBâ€™s **B-mode polarizatio**n will provide critical evidence for inflation and enable the detection of yet-to-be-observed **primordial gravitational waves**. In this work, we focus on reconstructing the primordial B-mode signal from simulated observational data, from the upcoming Indian space mission, Exploring Cosmic History and Origin (ECHO) (a.k.a. CMB Bharat). We employ state-of-the-art data analysis techniques, such as **score-based diffusion models using stochastic differential equations (SDE)**, with a denoising objective to reconstruct the required signal amidst highly contaminated detector noise. These models have the potential to **detect primordial B-modes**, as well as broader applications in astronomy and cosmology.</span>
