title:  A NOVEL SECTOR BASED ALGORITHM FOR AN OPTIMIZED STAR-GALAXY CLASSIFICATION

We devloped a novel sector-based methodology for star-galaxy classification, leveraging the latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey data (SDSS-DR18). By strategically segmenting the sky into sectors aligned with SDSS observational patterns and employing a dedicated convolutional neural network (CNN), we achieve state-of-the-art performance for star galaxy classification. Our preliminary results demonstrate a promising pathway for efficient and precise astronomical analysis, especially in real-time observational settings.

Recently, several research works have been developed to help astronomers by automatically classifying the galaxies (Soumagnac et al., 2015; Ba Alawi & Al-Roainy, 2021; Chaini et al., 2022; Kim & Brunner, 2016; Garg et al., 2022). However, these models perform well but are complex. In contrast to the existing work, due to the complexity of our star-galaxy system, in this research, we have proposed the development of a classification approach utilizing a sector-based division of the sky.

Featured below are the demonstration videos of our web tool in action. The first video highlights the tool's capability for conducting remote observations from the Raman Research Institute, located 90 km away from the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory. It also demonstrates the functionality to download collected data and perform minimal data processing. The second video showcases the updated version of the web tool, which now includes features for manual RFI masking and transit plotting, as exemplified through a solar transit observation.
