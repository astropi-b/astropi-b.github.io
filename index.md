# <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Welcome to My Page!</span>

I'm Anumanchi Agastya Sai Ram Likhit, and I am currently in my final year of my Integrated Masters (BS-MS) Degree in Physics with a minor in Data Science and a Master Thesis specialization in Observational Cosmology at [Indian Institute of Science EducationÂ  and Research Bhopal (IISER-B) , India](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/).

I am interested in solving astronomical and cosmological problems by using the latest advancements in machine learn- ing, artificial intelligence, and modern technology. My passion lies in observational astronomy and cosmology, where I aim to develop advanced observational data acquisition systems and data analysis pipelines related to astronomy and cosmology for a better understanding of the universe at different scales.

## A Thought-Provoking Quote

> "If the rate of expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, it would have recollapsed before it reached its present size. On the other hand, if it had been greater by a part in a million, the universe would have expanded too rapidly for stars and planets to form."  ~ Stephen W Hawking
