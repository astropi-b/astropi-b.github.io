# <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Welcome to My Page!</span>

I'm Anumanchi Agastya Sai Ram Likhit, and I am currently in my final year of my Integrated Masters (BS-MS) Degree in Physics with a minor in Data Science and a Master Thesis specialization in Observational Cosmology at [Indian Institute of Science EducationÂ  and Research Bhopal (IISER-B) , India](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/).

My academic journey is driven by a passion for exploring the mysteries of the universe and understanding the underlying principles that govern it. With a keen interest in astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, data science, and observational and instrumental astronomy, I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and engage in meaningful research. By implementing the latest advancements in data science and technology in astronomy, I aim to contribute to the growth and development of this fascinating field.



## A Thought-Provoking Quote

> "If the rate of expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, it would have recollapsed before it reached its present size. On the other hand, if it had been greater by a part in a million, the universe would have expanded too rapidly for stars and planets to form."  ~ Stephen W Hawking
